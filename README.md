# My Emotions for Poorvi ❤️  
Dear Poorvi,  

You're not just my best friend; you're my world. There are times when I might seem annoying or irritating—trust me, it's only because I crave your attention. 🥰 Your happiness means everything to me, and whenever you ignore me or scold me, it genuinely hurts more than I can explain. 💔  

But even in those moments, I cherish you because you are irreplaceable in my life. You're the one person I can always count on, and I hope you feel the same way about me. This website is a small attempt to show you how much I care and to let you know that I'm always here for you—through every laugh, every tear, and every moment in between.  

Thank you for being you. 💖
